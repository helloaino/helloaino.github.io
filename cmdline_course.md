####What I learned on the course

In the course Command-line Tools for Linguists I have learned the basics of Ubuntu for Windows. I can organize files and do basic text processing procedures such as make a frequency list of words from a text file. I have also learned to make and run bash scripts.

From making the final project I learned the basics of using Github and Jekyll to view my Github pages.
