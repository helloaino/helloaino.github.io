####Introduction
In this course I leared to work in a command-line environment (Ubuntu for Windows in my case) and using tools for text processing, writing bash-scripts and more. The course consisted of four Modules and a Final Project.

####Module 1: Introduction to Command Line Environments
In the first module, we installed our command-line environments and took the first steps to learning the basics of working in command-line. We were introduced to managing files and directories in the UNIX file system by moving, copying and removing directories. 

Basic commands:

'''console
ainojj@laptop1:~$ whoami
ainojj
'''

'''console
ainojj@laptop1:~$ mkdir KIK-LG221
ainojj@laptop1:~$ ls
KIK-LG221
'''
