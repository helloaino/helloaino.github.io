I work at Hive Corp in the nectar collection department, but I am also a Master's student in the General Linguistics track at the _Linguistic Diversity and Digital Humanities_ program at the University of Helsinki. My main interests are red, purple, and blue flowers and Language Typology. I am also interested in pursuing a minor in _Language Technology._

In this project I created a Github site that hosts my CV and personal profile.

## Misc. 
My work in the nectar sector and my studies at the University take up most of my time. I collect nectar usually in the mornings and attend classes in the afternoon. In my free time I help my co-workers with other tasks in the Hive, such as attending to the CEO and keeping the nest at the correct temperature. I am also the vice chair of my student organization.
